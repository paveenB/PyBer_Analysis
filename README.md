# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Purpose of the project is the perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data.  The project is to analyze the relationship in between number of riders and fare as well as the type of cities where Pyber ride share operates.  Exploration of the data will help determine and show where there can be improvement and if priceing has an effect on ridership.


## Results

The data reveals several findings from the analysis.

* Urban areas have highest demand in ride sharing
* Rural areas have the lowest demand in ride sharing
* Suburban areas have more rides tha Rural, but less than Urban areas.
* Urban areas have the most total fares, but least amount of fare per ride and per driver
* Rural areas have the least total fares, but most amount of fare per ride and per driver
* Suburban areas fall in between Rural and Urban areas

### Resulting Data

## Summary

The analysis shows a few changes that could be made for the Pyber ride sharing.  The Rural areas could use an increase in drivers to meet some of the demands, because the fare per ride seems to be higher.  This could indicate longer trips per ride.  An increase in Suburban drivers may also help to increase Total Fares.  Urban areas have the least amount of fare per ride indicating shorter trips.  There seems to be more drivers than total rides and there does not seem to be a need to increase drivers in the Urban areas
